# Matchups
- order our list of teams randomly
- check if the list is big enough - if not, add in 2^4 bye-teams (like in the picture Matchup System Model = you don't have to play a team in the first round)
- For a tournament to work you have to have 2 teams * 2 x 2 teams * 2 x 2 x 2 teams * 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 teams
- Create our first round of matchups
- Create every round after that

round 1
8teams : 2 = 4 matchups
matchup 1  team 1 |
		   team 2 | => team 1 

matchup 2  team 3 |
		   team 4 | => team 3

matchup 3  team 5 |
           team 6 | => team 5

matchup 4  team 7 |
		   team 8 | => team 7
----------------------------------
round 2
4 teams : 2 = 2 matchups

team 1 |
team 3 | => team 1

team 5 |
team 7 | => team 5
------------------------------------
round 3
2 teams : 2 = 1 matchup

team 1 |
team 5 | => team 1 = winner !

Num of rounds = cout of divizorii(Num of teams) - 1
